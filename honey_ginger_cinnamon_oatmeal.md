# Honey Ginger Cinnamon Oatmeal

## Ingredients

1 cup whole milk 
1/2 cup (50g) extra thick rolled oats 
1/2-1‚Äù thin nub of ginger, finely grated 
1 tsp cane sugar 
1/2 tsp of cinnamon 
1/2 tbsp (11g) of honey 

## Instructions

1. Add ginger and milk to a small heavy-bottomed saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often so as to not scorch the milk.
2. Once the milk begins to boil, add the sugar and oats to the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low.
3. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the milk and oats are creamy but still a little runny. They'll settle as they cool a bit.
4. Removee from the heat once you reach the desired consistency and transfer to a plate.
5. Let sit for 2 minutes so the oats have time to settle.
6. Sprinkle  with cinnamon and finish with strands of honey. 

### Notes
* It's important to add the ginger at the very beginning with the help so it has time to slowly flavor the milk.
* For a nice creamy oatmeal, cook closer to 12 minutes. Cook less time for a runnier, more hot cereal-like texture. Cook longer for a firmer, glueier texture (not recommended).
