# Salsa

## Ingredients
4 roma tomatoes  
1/4 of an onion (white or red or yellow)  
3 cloves or garlic, unpeeled  
1 serrano or jalapeño pepper  
1 lime, halved  
green onions (optional)  
cilantro (optional)  
salt, pepper, sugar or honey to taste  

## Instructions

1. Core the tomatoes and cut into halves or quarters.
1. Cover a baking sheet with foil and place the tomatoes flat face down, followed by the onions, pepper, and garlic cloves in their peels.
1. Turn the oven to broil (high) and place the baking sheet directly underneath it on the top rack. Watch for when the veggies begin to char, roughly 5-10 minutes, depending on your broiler. 
1. Once they start to char, flip them over and let go for another 5-10 minutes until the other side starts to char, too*.
1. Once everything is nicely charred, remove from the oven put into a blender -- removing the garlic from inside their peels. 
1. Add the juice of half a lime, some green onions if available, salt and pepper. 
1. Blend until as smooth or as chunky as you like**.  
1. Add more salt and pepper to taste.

Notes:  
\* The tomato will start to release some of its juices and that’s ok. Watch out for the garlic — if it starts to smell like it might burn just take it out sooner than the rest of the stuff, or keep it on the less hot parts of the baking sheet.  
** Take a taste, and adjust with lime if it needs more acidity, or add honey/sugar if it’s too acidic to balance it back out.
