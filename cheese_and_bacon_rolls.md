# Cheese and Bacon Rolls

## Ingredients

7g active dry yeast  
2 tsp caster sugar (or granulated or super fine white sugar)  
1 cup warm water (Not boiling. Just tap water is fine)  
3 cups or 360g bread flour  
1 tsp sea salt  
1 tbsp olive oil (or sub with any other oil)  
1 egg, lightly beaten  
1 cup grated cheese (cheddar, provolone, or gruyere)  
200-300g bacon, diced 

## Instructions
1. Combine yeast, sugar and warm water in a bowl. Whisk with a fork until yeast has dissolved. Stand in a warm place for 10 minutes or until frothy.
1. Combine the flour and salt in a bowl. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil. Then either use the dough hook on your mixer and mix for about 3 minutes on medium low, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface (about 100 kneads), until the dough is smooth and elastic. It should come away from the side of the bowl and shouldn't stick. If it is too sticky, add some extra flour.
1. Place the dough in a bowl and cover loosely. Set aside in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
1. Saut√© half the bacon in a non stick pan over high heat until lightly browned. Remove from pan and set aside to cool.
1. Spray baking tray with oil.
1. Punch down the dough, then cut into 8 pieces.
1. Get one piece of dough and flatten it. Top with 1 tbsp of cooked bacon and some cheese. Fold the edges in to "wrap" it, shaping it into a round shape. Seal then flip over and place on baking try. Flatten with your hand to around 2cm / 4/5" thick. Repeat with remaining dough.
1. Brush with egg mixture. Top each with 1 1/2 tbsp grated cheese and the uncooked bacon.
1. Cover with clean tea towel and set aside for 30 minutes or so in a warm place until it has risen by around 50%.
1. Preheat oven to 180C/350F.
1. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until they are golden brown. 
1. Cool on wire rack and serve whilst warm.

## Notes
* a great subsitute for bacon is ham from the deli (ask for one thick slice then dice at home)
