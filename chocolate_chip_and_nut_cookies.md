# Chocolate chip and nut cookies

## Ingredients
4 cups (480 g) sifted all-purpose flour  
1 tsp baking soda  
1 tsp salt  
3 sticks (1½ cups) unsalted butter, softened  
2 cups (400g) light brown sugar  
1½ cup (300 g) dark brown sugar  
½ cup (113 g) granulated sugar  
2 large eggs  
1 tbsp vanilla extract  
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips  
2 cups of nuts (walnut, pecans or macadamias)  


## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350ºF. 
1. Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and set aside. 
1. In a separate mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugars. Add eggs and vanilla and mix. Add the flour mixture, a little at a time, and mix. 
1. Mix in chocolate chips and nuts until combined.
1. Bake on parchment-lined baking sheets at 350ºF. Medium and small cookies bake until golden around the edges and just set in the center, 10 to 12 min. Don't overcook! They continue cooking on the pan out of the oven. Let cool slightly (if you can wait) and remove from pan.
If cookie dough has been chilled they will bake 12 to 14 minutes.
