# Banana bread

## Ingredients

1 1/2 cup self raising flour (or 1 1/2 cups white flour + 2 1/4 tsp baking powder + 3/4 tsp fine sea salt)  
1 teaspoon baking soda  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  
1/2 teaspoon vanilla  
1/2 cup light brown sugar  
1/2 cup dark brown sugar  
2 eggs, lightly beaten  
3 large, ripe bananas, mashed  
1/4 cup butter, melted  

## Instructions

1. Grease and flour loaf pans.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
3. In a bowl, whisk together flour, soda, salt and sugar. 
4. Mix in the slightly beaten eggs and mashed bananas. 
5. Slowly stir in the melted butter just until incorporated. 
6. Pour into prepared pans. 
7. Bake at 350 for 45-50 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean from the center. If you use the mini loaf pans, adjust to about 30 minutes. Just take a peek and if the top is starting to brown and looks cooked, try the toothpick to test for doneness. Let cool in pans for 5 minutes then turn out onto a rack to cool completely.

### Notes
* Do NOT over mix this batter. I would not use an electric mixer â€“ just a few circles of the wrist while incorporating the ingredients.
* Do NOT overbake. The moist, banana-y center should be soft and crumbly.
